ntroduction
CAMEL-AI is an open-source community for finding the scaling laws of agents for data generation, world simulation, and task automation.

​
What is CAMEL-AI?
CAMEL‑AI is an open‑source, modular framework for building intelligent multi‑agent systems. It provides the primitives to:
Create Agents that reason, plan, and act
Compose Societies of agents with defined roles
Integrate Interpreters for code execution and analysis
Manage Memory for long‑horizon context and learning
Orchestrate Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines
Generate Synthetic Data at scale with self‑instruct and verifier loops
Simulate Worlds and agent interactions in environments like social networks
​
Core Components
Agents: Atomic reasoning units driven by LLMs, capable of tool calls and decision‑making
Societies: Coordinator layers that assign roles, delegate tasks, and manage collaboration
Interpreters: Execution backends (Python, shell, browsers) for live code evaluation and automation
Memory & Storage: Persistent context layers for chat history, tool outputs, and learned knowledge
RAG Pipelines: Combine chunking, retrieval, and generation for grounded, accurate responses
Synthetic Data Engines: Self‑instruct, Chain‑of‑Thought, and Source2Synth pipelines with verifiers
World Simulation: Platforms like Oasis for large‑scale multi‑agent social simulations
Task Automation: Benchmarks like CRAB for real‑world multi‑step software workflows
